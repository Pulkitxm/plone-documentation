# Create a backend add-on

This section explains how a developer can create an {term}`add-on` for the Plone backend.
You will use a framework called {term}`GenericSetup`.

```{note}
This section for Plone 6 is in the process of being written.
Until it is complete, Plone 5 documentation is the authoritative source.
{doc}`plone5:develop/addons/components/genericsetup` (Plone 5)
