# Search

To index and search content in Plone, see the Plone 5 documentation {doc}`plone5:develop/plone/searching_and_indexing/index`.

Alternatively, you can integrate any open source search engine with your Plone site.

-   [Solr](https://solr.apache.org/) - See the add-on [`collective.solr`](https://github.com/collective/collective.solr) and its [documentation](https://collectivesolr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
-   [`collective.elasticsearch`](https://github.com/collective/collective.elasticsearch)
-   [`collective.elastic.plone`](https://github.com/collective/collective.elastic.plone)

You can find a comprehensive list of search options in [Awesome Plone - Searching and Categorizing](https://github.com/collective/awesome-plone?tab=readme-ov-file#searching-and-categorizing)
