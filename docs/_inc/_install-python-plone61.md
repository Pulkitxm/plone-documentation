Installing Python is beyond the scope of this documentation.
However, it is recommended to use a Python version manager, {term}`pyenv`, that allows you to install multiple versions of Python on your development environment without destroying your system's Python.

Plone 6.1 requires Python version {{SUPPORTED_PYTHON_VERSIONS_PLONE61}}.

```{warning}
Do not create or activate a Python virtual environment.
Doing so may cause installation errors.
Let the tools handle this for you.
Additionally the commands in this guide use explicit paths to packages.
